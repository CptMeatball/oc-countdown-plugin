# Countdown
A simple yet powerful plugin to display countdowns on your OctoberCMS website.

### Dependencies
- OctoberCMS framework for the Ajax Call: `{% framework extras %}`
- jQuery (Tested with 3.2.0, should work with others.)

### Usage

Drag and drop the `Countdown` component into your page and set the date property. This property should match the format of a Javascript DateTime object (`YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS`).
